# Prepopulate

The Prepopulate module allows fields in most forms to be pre-populated from 
the $_REQUEST variable.

For example, the following URL,

`http://www.example.com/node/add/blog?edit[title]=this is the title`

will automatically fill the Title field on a new blog post with the words "this 
is the title". Any field can be prepopulated this way. You can prepopulate more
than one field at a time as well. Prepopulate is excellent for creating 
bookmarklets.
